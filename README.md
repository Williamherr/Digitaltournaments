DigitalTournament is a website made to connect gamers together.
It is a place where people can hang out, play games, watch tournaments, and more.
DigitalTournament also hosts the best online tournaments in esports.
Many tournaments include games like Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Fortnite, League of Legends, StarCraft II, and more.
Que up with your friends to win a tournament or attend a tournament to connect with other people while spectating the games.
Make new friends by playing games with people you never met before. 
Sign up for available spots in the connection section. I created the website using node.js, express.js, JS, mongoose, HTML, and CSS.
